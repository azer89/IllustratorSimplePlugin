/*!
 With PlugPlug version 1.0, 
 this method tells PlugPlug to prepare to load an extension.
 
 When the Housing Plug-in wants to create a window and load an extension into it, 
 it must first invoke this API to notify PlugPlug so that PlugPlug can make any necessary preparations, 
 such as starting the CSI. 
 After calling PlugPlugLoadExtension, the Housing plug-in will create the window and 
 loads the swf inside it. After that, Housing plug-in needs to send "PlugPlugOpen" 
 event for the extension by calling PlugPlug.NotifyStateChange() API for the extension, 
 passing in the geometry at which the extension was created. 
 When PlugPlug receives "PlugPlugOpen" event, only then it will consider the extension to be loaded, 
 otherwise PlugPlug will not consider it loaded and all the calls for this extension 
 will return "PlugPlugErrorCode_extensionNotLoaded" error. 
 In case the Housing plug-in fails to create the window or fails to load the SWF and 
 wants to close extension, it needs to call PlugPlugUnloadExtension() API.
 
 
 With version 2.0, 
 PlugPlug is delegating the loading of an extension to the StageManager.
 
 A prerequisite for this to work is that the StageManager has been loaded 
 into its own hidden APE stage. 
 Therefore, before calling PlugPlugLoadExtension() the host application must 
 load the StageManager SWF by calling APEPlayerLoadSwf() of the APE API.
 The StageManager has been registered with the host application like any other extension.
 Hence, the path to the StageManager SWF is known to the host application.
 
 On calling PlugPlugLoadExtension(), the StageManager create a new window for the extension in ActionScript.
 It is setting window properties in accordance with the values specified in the extension manifest.
 "Opening" this window in ActionScript results in the host application receiving a new_stage event.
 The host application then creates a window and APE stage with the properties passed on in the event.
 Once the window is created, APE attaches the contents of the ActionScript window to the newly created APE stage.
 The ActionScript window contains an instance of the AS3 class SWFLoader which loads the extension SWF.
 
 \param[in] inExtensionID the extension to be loaded, previously registered by PlugPlug.
 \return a success or failure code.  If the return indicates an error, then PlugPlug is signalling the host that the load will fail, and the host application must \e not attempt it.  (This may happen, for example, if a user tries to load more concurrent extensions than the host supports.)  When an error occurs, PlugPlug may attempt to use scripting to give the user feedback about the problem.
 */
typedef PlugPlugErrorCode (*PlugPlugLoadExtensionFn)(const char* inExtensionID);


/*!
 \brief Tell PlugPlug to prepare to unload an extension.
 
 When the Housing Plug-in wants to tear down a window that has an extension running in it, it must first invoke this API to notify PlugPlug so that PlugPlug can prepare to stop execution of the extension (perhaps by destroying the associated script engine).
 \param[in] inExtensionID the extension to be stopped.
 \return a success or failure code.  If the return indicates an error, then PlugPlug is signalling the host that the unload will likely produce an error of some kind.  The host application is still free to tear the window down.  In such cases, PlugPlug may attempt to use scripting to warn the user about the problem.
